## Day 1
- Part 1: loop through the data to find the maximum.
- Part 2: keep all the sums for each elves, sort then sum the highest three.

## Day 2
- Part 1: loop through and compare the "hands".
- Part 2: similar but second column is the desired result.

Initially I did it "long hand" but went back and refactored to make it more compact.

## Day 3
- Part 1: loop, split and use a set to find the item that appears in both.
- Part 2: similar but compare three elves to find the common item.
